# Revealing the Reflexive Phone Tap
A Comprehensive Study on Userâ€™s Intuition in Mobile Applications

## Abstract
In this project, we analyzed app usage behavior from three datasets with Hadoop related big data software to find out: the category information behind the prevalent mobile apps, and typical patterns of user app usage behavior. The results could be useful to a range of segments associated with mobile applications such as Operating System Kernels, App Developers, and further research studies. We found out, from two of the datasets, Message and Utility app category are the most popular. And in one dataset, Game and Utility are the most popular. We also found out that user tend to use apps from the same category in a sequence. We also proposed that mobile os developers can use this information to optimize the os resource management. However, further research is needed for this theory.

## Introduction
Mobile applications have substantially revolutionized our lifestyles. From communications to entertainment, from ecom- merce to utility, applications are reshaping how humans inter- act with each other. Yet little is known about our intuition of interacting with these applications. In this project, we look into the app usage behavior patterns by analyzing three different data sources generated by real-world users. In the first section, we will first provide a preliminary analysis of the app usage datasets. We will then link those apps to their metadata in Google Play Store, in an effort to arrive at categorical conclusions about app-user interactions. In the third section, we further explore the cross-app relationships by drawing user paths in switching the apps. Our project can contribute to the field of usage pattern modeling by 1) integrating multiple data sources collected from various locations and 2) linking sequen- tial app usage with their respective meta-information. This study aims to look into datasets with different demographics and derive insights on multiple subjects that could further corroborate the existing studies in the emerging research field.
